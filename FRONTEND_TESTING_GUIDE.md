# FRONTEND TESTING GUIDE

## Current Status
✅ Backend is fully functional with all social media features
✅ Enhanced frontend authentication with detailed logging
✅ Authenticated actor creation implemented
❓ Testing Internet Identity flow with anchor 10000

## What Should Happen - New User Signup

### Step 1: Click "Join SocialNet"
- Should trigger `handleSignup()` function
- Console should show: `📝 SIGNUP: Starting SIGNUP...`

### Step 2: Internet Identity Authentication
- Internet Identity popup should open
- Create anchor 10000 (or any number)
- Should redirect back to app
- Console should show:
  ```
  📝 SIGNUP: Authentication successful
  📝 SIGNUP: Got principal: [some-principal-id]
  📝 SIGNUP: Creating authenticated actor...
  🔧 Creating authenticated actor with identity: [principal-id]
  🔧 Authenticated actor created successfully
  📝 SIGNUP: State set, this should trigger profile check useEffect
  ```

### Step 3: Profile Check
- Should trigger profile check useEffect
- Console should show:
  ```
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: useEffect triggered
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: isAuthenticated: true
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: currentUser: [principal-id]
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: userProfile: null
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: isSigningUp: true
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: authenticatedActor: exists
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: Conditions met, checking profile for user: [principal-id]
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: Using actor: authenticated
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: Profile result: null (or undefined)
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: No profile found for this principal
  👤 PROFILE_CHECK: User is signing up, showing registration
  ```

### Step 4: Registration Form
- Should show UserRegistration component
- Fill form with:
  - Username: Sarv29
  - Full Name: [Your name]
  - Email: [Your email]
  - Bio: Testing frontend flow
  - Location: [Your location]

### Step 5: Form Submission
- Click "Create Profile"
- Console should show:
  ```
  REGISTRATION: Form submitted
  REGISTRATION: Form data: [form data object]
  REGISTRATION: Calling create_user with data: [processed data]
  REGISTRATION: Using actor: authenticated
  REGISTRATION: Backend response: "User created successfully"
  REGISTRATION: User created successfully, calling onUserCreated
  REGISTRATION: Calling onUserCreated callback
  ```

### Step 6: Profile Creation Success
- Should trigger `handleUserCreated()`
- Console should show:
  ```
  USER_CREATED: Starting handleUserCreated
  USER_CREATED: Using actor: authenticated
  USER_CREATED: Fetched user profile: [user object]
  USER_CREATED: Valid profile found
  USER_CREATED: Profile set, navigating to feed
  ```

### Step 7: Main App Navigation
- Should navigate to main app (feed view)
- Should see navigation bar with Home, Discover, Create, Profile, Logout
- Should be able to create posts, view users, etc.

## What Should Happen - Existing User Login

### Step 1: Click "Sign In"
- Should trigger `handleLogin()` function
- Use same Internet Identity anchor (10000)

### Step 2: Profile Recognition
- Should automatically recognize existing profile
- Should navigate directly to main app
- Console should show profile found and navigation to feed

## Debugging Steps

### If Stuck on Landing Page:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for error messages
3. Look for the log messages listed above
4. Check if any step is failing

### Common Issues to Check:
1. **Internet Identity popup blocked** - Allow popups
2. **Authentication fails** - Check console for auth errors
3. **Actor creation fails** - Check for network/canister errors
4. **Profile check fails** - Check backend connectivity
5. **Form submission fails** - Check authenticated actor usage

### Backend Verification:
You can verify backend state with:
```bash
# Check user count
dfx canister call social_network_backend debug_user_count

# Check if specific user exists (replace with actual principal)
dfx canister call social_network_backend get_user '(principal "your-principal-here")'
```

## Expected Flow Summary:
1. **Signup**: Identity → Profile Form → Main App
2. **Login**: Identity → Main App (direct)
3. **Multi-user**: Each anchor = separate user account

## Test Data:
- **Anchor**: 10000 (or any number you choose)
- **Username**: Sarv29
- **Principal**: Will be generated by Internet Identity
- **Expected**: Complete profile creation and main app access
